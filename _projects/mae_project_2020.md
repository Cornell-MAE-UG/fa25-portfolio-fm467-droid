For this project, I designed a lifting mechanism within a 2D workspace measuring 150 cm in length and 50 cm in height. I selected a rigid bar of fixed length and three pin supports, ensuring that two were mounted to the ground as required. To provide actuation, I chose a linear actuator based on its maximum force specification from an online catalog. All components—including the supports, bar, and actuator—were assumed to be perfectly rigid. My primary objective was to optimize the arrangement to lift the heaviest possible load to the highest attainable point within the given design space. I carefully positioned the pin supports and actuator to maximize lifting height and load capacity. Throughout the process, I referenced actuator force limits and analyzed the mechanics of the frame to justify my design choices. All selections and calculations were made with the goal of achieving the best possible performance under the stated constraints.
