## Purpose and Real-World Relevance

In this lab, we analyzed a real water-to-water heat exchanger and compared its performance under parallel-flow and counterflow configurations. The objectives of the experiment were to:

- Describe the physical operation of a heat exchanger  
- Apply mass, energy, and entropy balances to a real system  
- Evaluate how operating and design changes affect performance  

Heat exchangers are critical components in many engineering systems, including automotive radiators, HVAC systems, power-plant condensers and feedwater heaters, chemical reactors with cooling jackets, and refrigeration systems. This lab provided a realistic thermodynamics application suitable for presentation to prospective employers.

## Device Description (Qualitative)

A heat exchanger transfers thermal energy from a hot fluid to a cold fluid without allowing the two fluids to mix. The fluids flow through separate channels, and heat is transferred through a solid wall from the hotter fluid to the colder fluid.

As the hot fluid releases heat, its temperature decreases, while the cold fluid absorbs this heat and warms up. Heat exchangers can be arranged in two primary configurations:

- **Parallel flow** – both fluids enter and flow in the same direction  
- **Counterflow** – the fluids flow in opposite directions  

In a parallel-flow exchanger, the temperature difference is largest at the inlet and decreases rapidly along the exchanger length, resulting in lower overall heat transfer. Counterflow maintains a larger temperature difference throughout much of the exchanger, allowing for greater heat transfer and improved heating of the cold fluid.

Increasing the inlet temperature of the hot fluid increases the driving temperature difference in both configurations, with counterflow benefiting the most.

## Measurements

### Temperature and Flow Rate Data

| Run | Configuration | Tc,in (°C) | Th,in (°C) | Tc,out (°C) | Th,out (°C) | Flow Rate (gal/hr) |
|-----|--------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 1 | Parallel flow | 6.8 | 40.0 | 15.9 | 24.6 | 210 |
| 2 | Parallel flow | 8.7 | 35.0 | 21.1 | 23.7 | 210 |
| 3 | Counterflow | 9.2 | 35.0 | 22.1 | 18.0 | 210 |
| 4 | Counterflow (hot start) | 10.0 | 40.0 | 23.9 | 19.6 | 210 |

### Heat Transfer Results

| Run | Configuration | ΔTc (K) | Qc (kW) | ΔTh (K) | Qh (kW) |
|-----|--------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Parallel flow | 9.1 | 8.40 | 15.4 | 14.21 |
| 2 | Parallel flow | 12.4 | 11.44 | 11.3 | 10.43 |
| 3 | Counterflow | 12.9 | 11.91 | 17.0 | 15.69 |
| 4 | Counterflow (hot start) | 13.9 | 12.83 | 20.4 | 18.83 |

Based on cold-side measurements, the heat exchanger transferred approximately **8–13 kW** across all runs.

Differences between the hot- and cold-side heat transfer rates are expected due to heat loss to the surroundings, unequal flow rates, imperfect reservoir mixing, and sensor lag. These effects are typical in real experimental systems.

### Effectiveness

![Effectiveness comparison](/assets/images/image-3.png)

| Run | Configuration | Effectiveness (ε) |
|-----|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | Parallel flow | 0.27 |
| 2 | Parallel flow | 0.47 |
| 3 | Counterflow | 0.50 |
| 4 | Counterflow (hot start) | 0.46 |

For the most direct comparison between flow arrangements, Run 2 (parallel flow) and Run 3 (counterflow) were analyzed because they had nearly identical inlet temperatures. Under these matched conditions, the counterflow configuration achieved slightly higher effectiveness and heat transfer.

## Conclusions

This experiment demonstrated practical thermodynamic analysis of a working heat exchanger:

- Cold-side heat transfer rates ranged from **8 to 13 kW**  
- Counterflow achieved higher effectiveness (0.50) than parallel flow (0.47) under similar inlet conditions  
- Increasing the hot inlet temperature in counterflow increased heat transfer by approximately **8%**  
- Energy mismatches were expected due to real heat losses and flow nonuniformities  

Overall, this lab illustrated how both design choices (flow arrangement) and operating conditions (inlet temperature) directly affect heat exchanger performance.
